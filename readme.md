#BOOP List by Chris Shum

My goal with the BOOP List was to have full functionality of a to do list packed within simplicity.  In other words, I wanted the entire app to work with one button.  In hindsight, this was probably a bad idea as it made the coding more complicated than it needed to be (if I had more buttons), but I enjoyed the challenge.



##How to use:

###Main screen:

  -To add new list:
  Enter your lists name into the text box and "BOOP".

  -To delete:
  Enter the name of the list you wish to delete and "BOOP".
  Enter 'y' and "BOOP" to confirm and execute the deletion.

  -To enter a list:
  Click on list name.


###In list screen:

  -To add new item:
  Enter your item into the text box and "BOOP"

  -To delete:
  Enter name of item you wish to delete and "BOOP".
  Enter 'y' and "BOOP" to confirm and execute the delete.

  -To save list and return to main screen;
  "BOOP" an empty field.
  Enter 'y' and "BOOP" to save and return to main screen.
